    "A projection is a mathematical operation that transforms data from one space to another. In the context of principal component analysis (PCA), a projection is used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the most important information about the data.\n",

    "PCA works by finding a set of orthogonal vectors (principal components) that capture the largest amount of variance in the data. These principal components can be used to project the original data onto a lower-dimensional subspace while retaining as much of the original information as possible.\n",

    "The projection of the data onto the principal components is achieved by multiplying the original data matrix by the matrix of principal components. The resulting transformed data is a lower-dimensional representation of the original data, where each new dimension is a linear combination of the original features.\n",

    "The choice of the number of principal components (PCs) can have a significant impact on the performance of principal component analysis (PCA).
